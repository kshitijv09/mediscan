# Mediscan

Mediscan is a symptom checker app. If you are not feeling well you can come here and ask Heal about the possible cause of your illness. It will require only a few minutes to find the cause and the best part about heal is, you do not need to write all the things by yourself, we integrate a voice assistant in the app powered by Dasha AI so you just need to answer a few questions and you are good to go.
